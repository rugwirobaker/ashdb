 Project Decision: CLI/REPL Virtual Machine

  Analysis Summary

  After examining the AshDB codebase and researching both projects, we've decided to implement the CLI/REPL Virtual Machine first.

  Current State

  - Store Interface: Clean Store trait with get(&[u8]), set(&[u8], Vec<u8>), scan operations - perfectly aligned with CLI needs
  - Challenge: Store works with raw bytes but users need human-readable types (strings, integers, etc.)
  - Current main.rs: Just "Hello, world!" placeholder

  Project Scope Assessment

  Block Caching: Medium-Large complexity
  - Requires cache implementation, performance benchmarking, memory management
  - Modifies critical storage engine paths
  - Needs sophisticated testing infrastructure

  CLI/REPL: Small-Medium complexity
  - Leverages existing Store trait directly
  - Primarily additive work (no modification of storage engine)
  - Provides immediate user value and testing foundation

  Key Insight: Encoding Layer Necessity

  From ToyDB research, we need:
  - Key Encoding: Order-preserving encoding (critical for SCAN ranges)
  - Value Encoding: Efficient serialization
  - Type Support: Strings, integers, floats, booleans

  Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Basic string key/value commands
  Phase 2: Add encoding layer for multiple data typesPhase 3: Advanced features (SCAN ranges, command history)

  Why CLI First

  1. Direct User Value: Enables immediate interaction with AshDB
  2. Testing Foundation: Perfect testbed for future block cache evaluation
  3. Lower Risk: Doesn't touch critical storage paths
  4. Incremental: Can start simple and grow in complexity
  5. Foundation: Will be needed for any future SQL layer

  The CLI provides the essential testing infrastructure needed to properly evaluate block caching performance when we implement that later.
